## Basic Defintions 

 **F&O** Future and Options represents Derivatives of Stock Market.These Derivatives are the financial instruments deriving their values from an underlying such as currency, gold, or the stocks of a company.

**DAO** (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.

The purpose of the project is to create a decentralized online F&O platform on tezos blockchain. 

## ![](https://github.com/Parizval/DeveloperDock/blob/master/srs/policy.png) Description  of  the  Proposal

Proposal aims to develop a decentralized platform for f&o trading which could utlized by anyone around the globe. Most of the platforms are centralized and governed by a single authority.  
This leads to serveral inefficies and drawbacks in the current platforms such as: 
 
 - Data is being fetched from a single source. 
 
 -  Central Monitoring  
 
## How do we solve such problems ? 
 
 - We plan to make the trading process much more transparent with the help of the blockchain.
 
 - Decentralized network of trusted oracles have proven to give much more reliable information. 
 
 - Premium Calculation for trading on smart contracts make the process transparent and removes hidden costs while trading.

## ![](https://github.com/Parizval/DeveloperDock/blob/master/srs/process.png) Workflow 

- Users would be register/login with the help of magic auth. 

- Functions such as **PUT** and **CALL** would be present on the dashboard of the platform along with the realtime pricing.

- Transactions to pay premium would be done with the help of AirGap/Thanos Wallet. 

- Details of the trade would be sent to the smart contract. 

- User would also be able to view his past trades. 

- Smart contract functions would be responsible for calculating the premium decay which makes the process of trading much more transparent.
